
Astonia To-Do List
==================

Bugs
----
- cmd_some_spell() gives "Warning: unknow spell 0". Caused by exec_cmd(): case CMD_SLF_CAST_K: ... Seems to be connected to the new keyboard shortcuts.

Soon
----

- "Clean up" zoomed map so it looks less pixelated

- A nice QoL change around stats now that have have tooltips could be when hovering over each
  stat display a tooltip that shows information such as current max mod, amount of mods added
  from equipment, percentage exp to raise

Possibly
--------

- Continue cleanup of GUI. Use DOTs instead of hardcoded pixel positions.

- Port the winsock stuff to SDL_net

- Add stuff to the client window to make it 960 pixels wide to fill a standard 16:9 display.

- Create mod for V3.5.


Maybe Later: Bugs
-----------------

- originx and originy are not correctly set for prefetch.

- Dragged help window should disable mouse-overs and buttons in top bar.

- Increase number of effects shown per map tile / character. Needs server side change.

- If the client is not focused, starting a mouse capture action (e.g. moving the help window) directly fails. This
  appears to be an SDL or operating system problem since the calls to SDL_WarpMouseInWindow() do nothing.


Maybe Later
-----------

- Redo the part of the character sprite tutorial that use the discontinued keyMate. Use the standard timeline instead.

- Move all parts of the client into separate windows, including the different chat channels.

- A Linux port. Once all is SDL it should be possible.
